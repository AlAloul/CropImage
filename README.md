Image cropping module for Appcelerator Titanium (Android)
=========================================

Description
-------------------
CropImage is a small image cropper. You can call this module in 'success' callback of showCamera or openPhotoGallery.
See examle for details.

WARNING!!
-------------------
Currently, for the sake of Titanium Mobile Android, this module works only when get called in app.js. I mean, when you call it in required JS file, you'll get mad because it does not work in that place. Thread related problem? I guess so, but please ask android guys in Appcelerator. No, not me.
