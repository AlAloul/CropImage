Image cropping module for Appcelerator Titanium (Android)
=========================================

Description
-------------------
CropImage is a small image cropper. You can call this module in 'success' callback of showCamera or openPhotoGallery.
See example for details.

WARNING!!
-------------------
Currently, this module works only when get called in app.js. I mean, when you call it in required JS file, callback function won't get fired so that it does not work. Thread related problem? I guess so. Please ask android guys in Appcelerator before you accuse me. No, not me.
